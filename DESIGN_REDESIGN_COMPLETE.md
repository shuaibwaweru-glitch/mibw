## 📲 URL Structure

### About .html Extensions
Your site currently shows `.html` in URLs like:
- www.mibw.org/gallery.html
- www.mibw.org/activities.html

**This is completely normal** for static HTML sites. The clean URLs (without .html) should work automatically on Vercel, so both of these work:
- www.mibw.org/gallery.html (always works)
- www.mibw.org/gallery (modern, clean)

No changes needed—Vercel handles this automatically!
