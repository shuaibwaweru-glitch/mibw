      <p class="hero-subheading" style="font-size: 1.2rem;">Manwell is not a healing. It is a forge.</p>
    </div>
  </section>

  <!-- ========== MISSION CONTENT ========== -->
  <section class="content-section reveal">
    <h2>The Silent Crisis</h2>
    <p>
      We confront the silent crisis: the performed man, the transactional worth, the warrior without a war.
    </p>
    <p>
      You have been taught to be useful, not true. To be strong, not sovereign. To perform, not to be. The result is a man hollowed out by his own achievement, standing at the peak and finding nothing but emptiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is not a failure of character. This is a failure of culture. A culture that forgot how to forge men, and instead manufactures performers.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- ========== MISSION STATEMENT ========== -->
  <section class="content-section reveal">
    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p style="font-size: 1.2rem; color: #ff5a09;">
      To guide men in the ultimate workâ€”fathering themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not through healing. Not through tactics or optimization. But through the confrontation of truth and the relentless forging of character.
    </p>
    <p>
      We believe that sovereignty comes not from running away from difficulty, but from standing in the fire and allowing it to shape you. That a man's worth is not measured by what he produces, but by the integrity of his word and the depth of his presence.
    </p>
    <p>
      We believe in the unspoken truths: that masculine depth is not something to be ashamed of, that strength is not something to perform, and that the man you were meant to become is waiting on the other side of your own resistance.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- ========== FOUNDATIONAL TEXTS ========== -->
  <section class="content-section reveal">
    <h2>The Foundational Texts</h2>
    <p style="color: #808080; font-size: 0.95rem; margin-bottom: 2rem;">
      These are the words that form the bedrock of Manwell. Read slowly. Let them settle.
    </p>

    <!-- Text 1: The Marble Man -->
    <div style="margin-bottom: 3rem; padding: 2rem; border-left: 3px solid #4a9b8e; background: #f8f9fa; border-radius: 4px;">
      <h3 style="color: #4a9b8e;">The Marble Man</h3>
      <p style="font-style: italic; color: #6b7a8a;">
        You were born with marble inside you. Not the soft kind that breaks easily, but the kind that requires fire to sculpt. The world has tried to smooth your edges, to make you safe and acceptable. But the marble remains. And it will wait. It will wait for you to find the fire within and begin the work of your own becoming.
      </p>
      <p style="color: #6b7a8a;">
        The man you are pretending to be is made of glass. Beautiful, perhaps. Reflective. But fragile. The real manâ€”the one made of marbleâ€”is waiting underneath.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- Text 2: The Last Bell -->
    <div style="margin-bottom: 3rem; padding: 2rem; border-left: 3px solid #4a9b8e; background: #f8f9fa; border-radius: 4px;">
      <h3 style="color: #4a9b8e;">The Last Bell</h3>
      <p style="font-style: italic; color: #6b7a8a;">
        There is a bell ringing. It has been ringing your entire life. It is the call to sovereignty. And every time you choose comfort, every time you choose the performance, every time you choose to be useful instead of trueâ€”the bell grows quieter.
      </p>
      <p style="color: #6b7a8a;">
        The question is not whether the bell will stop ringing. It will. The question is: will you answer it before it does?
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- Text 3: The Ghost -->
    <div style="margin-bottom: 3rem; padding: 2rem; border-left: 3px solid #4a9b8e; background: #f8f9fa; border-radius: 4px;">
      <h3 style="color: #4a9b8e;">The Ghost</h3>
      <p style="font-style: italic; color: #6b7a8a;">
        You are haunted by the man you could have been. He walks beside you every day. He whispers in the moments when you're alone. He is not angry. He is simply disappointed. Not in what you've done, but in what you've refused to become.
      </p>
      <p style="color: #6b7a8a;">
        This ghost is not your enemy. He is your invitation. He is the man waiting on the other side of your own resistance. And the only way to lay him to rest is to become him.
      </p>

  <!-- ========== IMAGE + TEXT SECTIONS ========== -->
  <section style="padding: 6rem 2rem; background: #ffffff;">
    <div style="max-width: 1400px; margin: 0 auto;">
      <!-- Section 1: The Forge -->
      <div style="display: grid; grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr; gap: 3rem; align-items: center; margin-bottom: 6rem;">
        <div class="reveal">
          <img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1552664730-d307ca884978?w=600&h=500&fit=crop" alt="The Forge - Men Working" style="width: 100%; height: 400px; object-fit: cover; border-radius: 8px;">
        </div>
        <div class="reveal">
          <h3 style="font-size: 1.8rem; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">The Forge Isn't Metaphorical</h3>
          <p style="line-height: 1.9; color: #4a5568; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">Real fire. Real heat. Real transformation. You don't become sovereign in comfort. You become sovereign in the space where everything false burns away.</p>
          <p style="line-height: 1.9; color: #4a5568;">The forge is where soft iron becomes strong. Where pretense becomes power. Where the boy you were learns to father himself.</p>
          <div style="height: 3px; width: 40px; background: #4a9b8e; margin-top: 2rem;"></div>
        </div>
      </div>

      <!-- Section 2: The Work -->
      <div style="display: grid; grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr; gap: 3rem; align-items: center; margin-bottom: 6rem; direction: rtl;">
        <div class="reveal">
          <img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1506794778202-cad84cf45f1d?w=600&h=500&fit=crop" alt="The Work - Man Reflecting" style="width: 100%; height: 400px; object-fit: cover; border-radius: 8px;">
        </div>
        <div class="reveal" style="direction: ltr;">
          <h3 style="font-size: 1.8rem; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">The Work Begins Inside</h3>
          <p style="line-height: 1.9; color: #4a5568; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">You cannot build a man from the outside in. Every achievement, every accolade, every external victoryâ€”it's all temporary if the inside is hollow.</p>
          <p style="line-height: 1.9; color: #4a5568;">The work is internal. It's brutal. It's honest. And it's the only work that matters.</p>
          <div style="height: 3px; width: 40px; background: #4a9b8e; margin-top: 2rem;"></div>
        </div>
      </div>

      <!-- Section 3: The Brotherhood -->
      <div style="display: grid; grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr; gap: 3rem; align-items: center;">
        <div class="reveal">
          <img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1552058544-f2b08422138a?w=600&h=500&fit=crop" alt="The Brotherhood - Men Together" style="width: 100%; height: 400px; object-fit: cover; border-radius: 8px;">
        </div>
        <div class="reveal">
          <h3 style="font-size: 1.8rem; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">You Don't Do This Alone</h3>
          <p style="line-height: 1.9; color: #4a5568; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">The myth of the lone wolf is a lie that keeps men isolated. Real strength is in brotherhood. In vulnerability. In standing with other men who refuse to perform.</p>
          <p style="line-height: 1.9; color: #4a5568;">You need witnesses. You need accountability. You need men who will call you out and call you forward.</p>
          <div style="height: 3px; width: 40px; background: #4a9b8e; margin-top: 2rem;"></div>

      This is not for everyone. It is for the man who is tired of his own performance. If that is you, stand with us.
